# Speculative Decoding

[README](../README.md)

Speculation proposes future tokens with a smaller draft block, then checks
them with the main model. An accepted prefix advances generation by several
tokens in one verification pass. It does not accelerate prefill.

It is opt-in. Gains depend on the prompt, model, backend, and context length;
poor acceptance can make it slower. Measure your workload rather than assuming
that a draft model always helps.

## DeepSeek Flash: DSpark

DSpark is a separate support GGUF, not a standalone language model. It proposes
up to five future tokens. Match its checkpoint to the main model:

| Main checkpoint | Download | Support file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flash 0731 | `ds4f-dspark` | `gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf` |
| Flash Vision Experimental | `ds4f-vision-dspark` | `gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp-DSpark-support.gguf` |

For the 0731 Q2 model:

```sh
./download_model.sh ds4f-q2
./download_model.sh ds4f-dspark
./ds4 --dspark --mtp-model gguf/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark-support-0731.gguf
```

For Vision Experimental, substitute its matching main model and support file.
Do not mix the two checkpoints. DSpark is not supported for PRO.
The same flags work in `ds4-agent` and non-batched `ds4-server` requests.

The support file adds about 5.6 GiB of weights plus runtime state. On Metal,
the main model can be resident or SSD-streamed. DSpark replaces the legacy
one-stage MTP drafter for that run; the two are not stacked.

Resident M5 paths batch supported verifier expert rows, including two-Mac TP.
On DGX Spark, resident Q2 also batches the seed with longer drafts and uses
small-batch Q8 and expert kernels. No extra flags are needed.
The scheduler can back off when drafting is unproductive. Defaults select the
fast paths; diagnostic environment variables are not needed for normal use.
Recorded comparisons are in [the QA guide](../QA_BEFORE_RELEASES.md).

For the tested Strix Halo coding configuration, use `--dspark --dspark-confidence 0.7` with the default five-token draft cap and scheduler. Client sampling is temperature `1.0`, `top_p=0.95`, `min_p=0`, and `top_k=0`; high reasoning was also checked on coding and tool-use requests. This uses opportunistic sampling as described below; exact-mode throughput is not qualified by these measurements. `--mtp-draft` controls legacy autoregressive MTP, not the DSpark draft width.

## DeepSeek Flash: context n-gram drafting

`--ngram-spec N` drafts up to `N` tokens per cycle without any support
model: the drafter finds the most recent earlier occurrence of the last few
context tokens and proposes the tokens that followed it (prompt-lookup
decoding). The table is the live prompt plus generated tokens, rescanned
each cycle, and the DSpark batched verifier and back-off scheduler check the
proposal, so acceptance is lossless: a draft token survives only where the
target model's own greedy continuation agrees.

```sh
./ds4 --ngram-spec 5
```

Gains depend on repetition: code completion, lists, and echoed structure
accept well; sparse prose stays near neutral, and the scheduler backs off
when drafting is unproductive. The same flag works in `ds4-bench` and
`ds4-agent`, and greedy server requests pick it up automatically.
Non-zero temperature ignores the drafter (v1 is greedy only).
`DS4_NGRAM_SPEC_SIZE` overrides the match length (default 3), and
`DS4_DSPARK_STATS=1` prints acceptance counters. It cannot be combined
with DSpark/MTP support models.

The shared scheduler pauses drafting after rejected proposals: the first
consecutive miss is left unpunished (an echoed pattern usually re-locks on
the very next proposal), and further consecutive misses double the pause
(2, 4, 8 ... up to 64 cycles) so rejection-heavy passages decode at full
speed instead of paying a batched verify per miss, while any accepted draft
restores drafting immediately. The same backoff governs DSpark.
`DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_EXP_BACKOFF_BASE=0` restores the older flat pauses
only, `DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_EXP_BACKOFF_CAP` bounds the longest pause, and
`DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_EXP_BACKOFF_MIN_STREAK=1` also pauses after a single
miss.

Accepted cycles also accrue credit (one per accept, two for a full-width
accept, up to `DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_EXP_BACKOFF_CREDIT`, default 16): a
rejected proposal spends one credit instead of growing the miss streak, so
a long high-acceptance stretch keeps drafting through its isolated misses —
pausing there would only shift the drafting phase out of the repeating
pattern — while a genuinely dead passage still reaches the exponential
ladder once the saved credit runs out. `DS4_DSPARK_SCHEDULER_EXP_BACKOFF_CREDIT=0`
disables credit and keeps the bare miss-streak ladder.

## GLM: built-in MTP

GLM's draft block is already in its main GGUF:

```sh
./ds4 -m gguf/GLM-5.3-Flash-Q2.gguf --mtp
```

`--mtp-timing` also enables it and prints acceptance and timing counters.
The current GLM cycle commits up to two tokens. No external support file is
needed, and ordinary decode remains the default.

## Qwen3.8: built-in MTP

Both Qwen downloads include MTP and native BF16 n-grams in the main GGUF:

```sh
./download_model.sh qwen38-q4k
./ds4 --mtp
```

Ordinary decode uses the same file with `--mtp` omitted. For non-zero
temperature, add `--mtp-exact-sampling` to preserve the target sampling
distribution. See [Qwen setup](QWEN38_FLASH_NEXT.md) for Metal and CUDA.

The cycle drafts one token ahead by default and engages a **second, chained
draft** (one extra nextn-layer step conditioned on the predictor's own
stream, verified in a 3-row pass) while recent first-draft acceptance is
perfect, disengaging after repeated second-draft rejections.
`DS4_QWEN4_MTP_DEPTH=2` or `=3` fixes the depth;
`0` (default) is the adaptive policy.

## Sampling and reproducibility

At temperature zero, accepted drafts must match the target's greedy
continuation. At non-zero temperature, the default mode is opportunistic:
ordinary tokens use the requested sampling settings, but matching greedy
drafts are accepted directly. Sampling resumes when the proposed suffix does
not match. This is deliberately more deterministic than ordinary sampling.

Use `--mtp-exact-sampling` to preserve the ordinary target sampling
distribution. Exact mode accepts greedy proposals with their target
probability and samples from the remaining distribution on rejection.

When a verified block crosses a tool sampling-mode boundary (for example
entering tool-call syntax during server decoding), the server rewinds to the
block start and re-evaluates the boundary token so the next sample uses the
new mode. Under exact sampling that rewind restores a pre-verify snapshot of
the recurrent state instead of resetting the graph, so long retained
contexts are not replayed at every boundary.

Accepted tokens keep the state produced by the batched verifier. Floating-point
reduction order can differ from one-token decode, so long greedy continuations
need not be byte-identical. For DeepSeek comparisons against the ordinary
target-only path, use `--quality` or `--dspark-strict`; these disable the
speculative acceptance path. They do not promise identical output across
different hardware or execution configurations.

Session-batched serving uses ordinary target decoding instead of combining
DSpark/MTP with the session batch. See [serving](SERVER.md#multiple-sessions).
